## OneLess

OneLess is a web application created with the [mern.io boilerplate](http://mern.io).

Did you know that $165 billion worth of food gets thrown away in the U.S. every year? Additionally 1 in 6 people in America face hunger.  In order to address this issue, we created OneLess, short for OneLess Hungry Person.  This app easily connects hungry people with accessible food.
